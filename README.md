Project Description/Outline:

Our project is to analyze market returns of the top corporations within several industry sectors in the US over a five-year period to find possible correlations. We will answer questions on investment strategies for developing a more diverse investment portfolio based on our analysis.  We will also be comparing these market returns to the SP500 as a control variable in our study.
Sectors to be studied include Oil & Gas, Airlines, Pharmaceuticals, High-Technology, Entertainment, and several more.

Research Questions to Answer:

•	Is there correlation between the industry sectors?

•	What is the correlation between these industries and the SP500? (Optional: Find the BETA for each industry to determine whether the stock moves alongside the average market)

•	What is the standard deviation of returns for the top companies of each sector? (Higher STD of returns could refer to a more volatile market which is lucrative for speculation traders)

•	Create a correlation matrix with all top companies in our study (Could be a good reference for creating a more diverse portfolio)

•	Create graphs, correlation and linear regression models, and other visualization models to present to potential investors.

•	Can we use our findings to predict future prices based on regression analysis? 

•	Can we use our findings to make future predictions based on correlation across different sectors?

Datasets to Be Used:

•	Finance.yahoo.com (Majority of our datasets)

•	Seekingalpha.com (Good source, but not free)

•	Potential for more sources to augment our final product after the core skeleton is completed.

Rough Breakdown of Tasks:

Clay- Manage Git Repository, delegate branches and work. Help others with research. Big picture.

Tunde- Financial Expert. Manage selection of top companies and sectors to be studied and analyzed.

Irina- Download CSV files for sectors to be studied. Create initial Data Frames.

Lucas- Help with initial creation of Data Frames. Manage any Data Cleaning / Merging that needs to take place before we begin our analysis.
